Simulate a horde for a D&D campaign where the players get to create a maze
that is magically created within a tower keep, the horde count is based on a 100 percentile die.

The maze is created by players whom are given a short time to make a map within photoshop/gimp using a 60 px black brush to create walls, 
players are warned that magical based walls must be straight and with no rounded corners, spacing between walls and paths must be 60 px
or the width of the brush/walls (pre-set in app). Image is then saved as a jpg (1666x1565 pixels) to a file called bound3.jpg saved in root directory
of the netlogo maze folder. Once netlogo is up, players are asked to place themselves on the map, by clicking on the map within netlogo, the pixel
will turn Orange (pre-set). Once a horde member touches the orange pixel it will turn black and players failed, and sim will stop. If the timer 
runs out and players are not touched, the spell is complete and players win.

RED pixels represent danger/death to NPC horde members.

NOTE 1: the ticks option on the interface page should be set from Continuous to "on tick"
NOTE 2: DM can double click map to place extra traps for horde if needed

Players may view the netlogo screen during the event, however cannot move during the spell casting event.
